Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial preliminary step before applying linear regression [NUMBER: 5 https://www.codecademy.com/learn/eda-exploratory-data-analysis-python]. It helps understand the data, identify relationships between variables, and ensure the suitability of using linear regression [NUMBER: 3 https://ksvmuralidhar.medium.com/basic-exploratory-data-analysis-template-for-regression-problems-20ca00c58f7d, NUMBER: 4 https://medium.com/@kaushalgupta198/exploratory-data-analysis-and-regression-8cc50c9bf51a].

Here's why EDA is important for linear regression:

Identify patterns and relationships: EDA techniques like visualizations can reveal linear relationships between the independent and dependent variables, which is a core assumption of linear regression [NUMBER: 2 https://blog.exploratory.io/introduction-to-linear-regression-model-in-exploratory-a46e90d62f7d, NUMBER: 4 https://medium.com/@kaushalgupta198/exploratory-data-analysis-and-regression-8cc50c9bf51a].
Check for outliers and anomalies: EDA can help detect outliers that can significantly affect the regression line and model [NUMBER: 5 https://www.codecademy.com/learn/eda-exploratory-data-analysis-python].
Identify potential issues: EDA can uncover data quality problems like missing values or skewed distributions, which might require pre-processing before using linear regression [NUMBER: 6 https://www.kaggle.com/code/jmullan/eda-and-linear-regression-prediction].
By performing EDA, you can ensure that your data meets the assumptions of linear regression and build a more accurate and reliable model [NUMBER: 1 https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/02/introduction-to-exploratory-data-analysis-eda/].
